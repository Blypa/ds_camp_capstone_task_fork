    "**1.1. Install `pyenv`:**\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.2. Configure Your Shell for `pyenv`:**\n",
    "After installation, you need to add a few lines to your shell's configuration file (.bashrc, .zshrc, .profile, etc.) so that pyenv loads automatically. The installer usually tells you exactly which lines to add. Most often, they look like this:\n",

    "```bash\n",

    "* --skip-existing is a flag that will skip the installation if this version already exists.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.3. Link the Environment to Your Project:**\n",
    "This is the most convenient feature of `pyenv`. We can specify that our project folder should automatically activate the correct environment.\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "# Navigate to your project folder\n",

    "# **Part 2: Semantic Search - Embeddings and FAISS**\n",
    "\n",
    "This module is the heart of our intelligent search engine. But before we dive in, let's understand the problem we're solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem with Traditional Keyword Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a standard search function (like Ctrl+F). It's great at finding exact word matches. However, it completely fails to understand the *meaning* or *context*. For example:\n",
    "- A user searches for **\"summer clothes\"**.\n",
    "- A product is described as **\"a light sundress for warm weather\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A traditional keyword search will **fail** to find this product because the exact words don't match. This is a huge limitation for creating a user-friendly experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Searching by Meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semantic Search** overcomes this limitation by understanding the *intent* behind the words. It knows that \"summer clothes\" and \"a light sundress\" are conceptually related. To achieve this, we need a way to represent the meaning of text numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where our two key technologies come into play:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Embeddings:** An embedding is a vector (a list of numbers) that serves as a text's \"coordinate\" in a high-dimensional \"meaning space\". A specialized AI model reads a piece of text and converts it into a vector. Texts with similar meanings will have vectors that are very close to each other in this space.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search):** Our search task now becomes a mathematical problem: given the vector for a user's query, find the product vectors that are closest to it. Comparing the query vector to every single product vector one-by-one would be incredibly slow with thousands of items. **FAISS** is a highly optimized library that builds a special index of all our product vectors, allowing it to find the \"nearest neighbors\" almost instantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Plan for This Module:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our workflow is divided into two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indexing (an offline step):** We will take all our product descriptions, use an embedding model to convert them into vectors, and build a FAISS index to store them efficiently.\n",
    "- **Searching (an online step):** We will take a user's live query, convert it into a vector, and use our pre-built FAISS index to rapidly find the most similar products."

    "# **Part 3: Text Summarization with an LLM**\n",
    "\n",
    "Having built our retrieval system (semantic search), let's now focus on a purely **generative** task: summarization. The goal is to take a potentially long piece of text and have an AI generate a concise, easy-to-read summary that captures the main ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Power of Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, we will use a **Large Language Model (LLM)**. An LLM is a massive neural network trained on an incredible amount of text from the internet. This training allows it to understand grammar, context, facts, and even nuanced writing styles. Because of this deep understanding, LLMs are exceptionally good at tasks like summarization. They can read a document, identify the key points, and then generate new, shorter text in fluent, human-like language.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run these powerful models on our own machines, we use **Ollama**. It's a fantastic tool that downloads and serves LLMs locally, giving us a private and powerful AI assistant without sending our data to the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Art of Asking: Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture for this service is straightforward:\n",
    "`[Frontend (Streamlit)] <--> [Backend (FastAPI)] <--> [LLM (Ollama)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important part of this interaction happens in the backend, where we craft the request to the LLM. This is known as **prompt engineering**. The quality of the LLM's output is highly dependent on how well we formulate our prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good prompt typically consists of:\n",
    "1.  **A System Message:** An instruction that sets the context and defines the AI's role (e.g., \"You are an expert summarizer.\"). This guides the model's tone and focus.\n",
    "2.  **A Human Message:** The user's input, in this case, the text that needs to be summarized.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we will examine our `TextSummarizer` class, which uses the `LangChain` library to structure these prompts and communicate with our local Ollama model to get the job done."

    "\n",
    "For our agent, the state is simple: it just contains a list of messages that represents the \"scratchpad\" for the current task. The `Annotated[list, add_messages]` syntax is a special `LangGraph` helper that ensures new messages are always *added* to the list, not replaced. This is how the scratchpad gets filled."

    "\n",
    "A simple chain just goes from start to finish. An **agent** is more powerful because it can decide its next step and even loop, which mimics a reasoning process. Our agent's intelligence comes from this simple, cyclic graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Agent Node:** The agent first receives the user's request and thinks about what to do. It might decide to answer directly (summarize), or it might decide to use a tool (get the date).\n",
    "2.  **Decision (Conditional Edge):** The graph then checks the agent's decision.\n",
    "    - If the agent provided a final answer, the process ends.\n",
    "    - If the agent decided to use a tool, the process moves to the `tools` node.\n",
    "3.  **Tools Node:** The requested tool (e.g., `get_current_date`) is executed, and its output is recorded on the scratchpad (`messages`).\n",
    "4.  **Loopback:** The flow **must** return to the `agent` node. This is the most critical step! The agent now sees the original request *and* the result from the tool, allowing it to formulate a final, helpful response to the user (e.g., \"Today's date is...\").\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates the following flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Agent flow](./agent.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "`START` -> `agent` -> (Does the response contain a tool call?)\n",
